To achieve the functionality you described for your web application, you will need to perform several steps, including setting up your MySQL database, creating JSP files, and configuring your servlets. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Set Up MySQL Database:

Follow the previous instructions to set up MySQL as a Docker container.
Create a database for your application and define the necessary tables to store user registration data.
2. Create JSP Files:

Create the index.jsp file for the login page.
Create the registration.jsp file for the registration page.
Create the dashboard.jsp file for the dashboard page.
Create the success.jsp file for the registration success page.
3. Create Servlets:

Create a servlet to handle user registration. This servlet should validate the registration data, insert it into the MySQL database, and then redirect to the success page or back to the registration page with an error message if registration fails.
Create a servlet to handle user login. This servlet should validate the login credentials against the MySQL database and then redirect to the dashboard page upon successful login or back to the login page with an error message if authentication fails.
4. Configure web.xml:

Configure your web.xml file to map servlets to their corresponding URLs. Here's an example of what the configuration might look like:
xml
Copy code
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>RegistrationServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.yourpackage.RegistrationServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>RegistrationServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/register</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

<servlet>
    <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.yourpackage.LoginServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
5. Implement Servlets:

In your RegistrationServlet, implement the logic to validate registration data, insert it into the MySQL database, and handle the redirection.
In your LoginServlet, implement the logic to validate login credentials against the MySQL database and handle the redirection.
6. Use Session for Authentication:

After successful login, store the user's authentication status (e.g., their username) in a session attribute. You can use HttpSession for this purpose.
In your dashboard and other protected pages, check if the user is authenticated by verifying the session attribute. If not authenticated, redirect them to the login page.
7. Display Success and Error Messages:

In your JSP pages (registration.jsp, index.jsp, dashboard.jsp, and success.jsp), use JSTL or scriptlets to display success and error messages based on the data received from your servlets.
With these steps in place, your web application should be able to perform user registration, login, and dashboard access based on user authentication. Make sure to handle exceptions and validation thoroughly in your servlets to provide a smooth user experience.
